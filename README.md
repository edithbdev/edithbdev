### Hi there 👋, I'm Edith

## ✨ Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice ! ✨

🐍 I discovered programming and loved it!  

📚 At O'Clock School I learned : ✨ front-end with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript ⚙️ back-end with PHP, object oriented programming, Laravel, SQL, APIs 🤝 Agile methodology with SCRUM, and tools like git or trello  

🐘 Then I specialised in Symfony  

🌄 I also explore React in my free time  

🤓 I keep on learning everyday with my projects  

👀 I'm curious about everything relative to web development, and always eager to learn!
